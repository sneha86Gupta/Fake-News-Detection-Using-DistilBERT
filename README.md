# Fake-News-Detection-Using-DistilBERT
This project aims to classify news articles as FAKE or REAL using both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning with DistilBERT. We compare multiple models, analyze performance, and visualize results to identify the best-performing approach for fake news detection.
